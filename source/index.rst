Welcome to card_deck's documentation!
=====================================

We propose a validated computational model of the spread of an antibiotic
resistant pathogens in a hospital, with and without our diagnostic tool for
quickly identifying it, and show that in a relevant scenario it reduces the
presence of antibiotic resistant pathogens in our selected scenario, showing our
product is beneficial in the real-world.

We used Python to implement a discrete time, stochastic, compartmental model of
the spread of antibiotic resistant pathogens through a population.
